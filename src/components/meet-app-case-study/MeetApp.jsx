          The goal was to develop an application that seamlessly fetches events
          from the Google Calendar API and presents them in an intuitive user
          interface. Additionally, visual elements such as pie charts and
          scatter plots were implemented to effectively represent the types and
          number of events.

          I needed a reliable data source for my APIâ€”a database that could
          provide events for rendering in my React application. Additionally, I
          had to design an intuitive way to visually represent the fetched
          events, including their count and categories, ensuring a clear and
          user-friendly experience.

            I retrieved data from the Google Calendar API, which acted as my

            Accessing the Google calendar API was not simple because it is a
            protected API. This means that it can only be accessed by
            authenticated apps. If not authenticated, you would get this error:
          </p>
          <img
            src={errorMessage}
            alt="error message"
            style={{ width: "40rem" }}
          />
        </div>

        <div style={{ marginTop: "4rem" }}>
          <p>
            To retrieve data from the Google Calendar API, my React app required
            authorization via an authorization token. The app needed a mechanism
            to obtain and manage this token to authenticate requests and
            securely access the API.
          </p>

          <p>
            The app utilized Google's authorization server to authenticate
            users, verifying their identity, and authorize access to calendar
            events within the React app.
          </p>
          <div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "1rem" }}>
            <p>
              Upon logging in with their Google account and granting
              permissions, the app received an authorization token. This token
              allowed the app to securely access protected resources, such as
              calendar events, on behalf of the user.
            </p>
            <img src={oauthImage} alt="oauth image" />

        <div style={{ marginTop: "4rem" }}>
          <p>
            To access the Google Calendar API, I needed a valid OAuth2 token.
            This required a mechanism to obtain and manage the token
            efficiently. Implementing and maintaining a dedicated server solely
            for token retrieval was unnecessary and impractical. Instead, a
            serverless function was used to handle the authorization flow.
          </p>
          <div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "1rem" }}>
            <p>
              The logic for obtaining the access token from the authorization
              server was implemented within a serverless function, ensuring
              scalability and efficiency. AWS Lambda was used to deploy this
              function, which was written in Node.js with Express.js, enabling
              secure and reliable token retrieval.

          <p>For the charts I used a library named Recharts.</p>
          <p>
            Recharts is a React-based charting library that allowed me to create
            customizable, responsive, and data-driven charts. It provided me
            with a simple API with prebuilt components of PieChart, and
            ScatterChart, making it easy to integrate visualizations into my
            React application.
