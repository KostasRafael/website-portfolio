      <h1>Hello, my name is Konstantinos Rafael Manousoudakis.</h1>
      <p>
        Since the very beginning of my adulthood, and up to this very present
        day, I have made sure to always express my curiosity and love of
        interacting with people. For about ten years I worked in the tourist
        industry as a hotelier in Greece. I was working seasonally, only in the
        summer when Greece is packed with visitors. My winters were free, and I
        used this freedom in doing one of the most amazing things one can do,
        LEARNING. The perfect balance, half year being busy in the hecting
        environment of the tourist industry, surrounded by all kinds of people,
        outside in nature and all itâ€™s forces, and half year immersing myself
        into libraries, universities and other educational institutions,
        learning and improving myself in every way I could.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        {" "}
        I graduated in Philosophy at a top 10 university of the UK, the
        university of Warwick, I perfected my use of the English language, I
        learned music theory and playing the guitar and I traveled many
        different countries and mixed with a great variety of cultures.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        {" "}
        About 1 year ego, once again, I decided to embark on a new journey and
        follow my curiosity about computers and the internet. And I absolutely
        loved it from the get go. This led me to completing the CareerFoundry
        course on web-development, where I learned different programming
        languages and tools, and I built and published my first real
        applications. Real applocations that people can use to facilitate and
        improve their lives.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        In this tech world, I once again proved my ability to learn fast and my
        adaptability to new settings and challenges. I thrived in using new
        technologies, and in applying my strong sense of logic and
        problem-solving skills to finding optimal solutions to real-life
        problems.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        This is a short synopsis of my journey so far, and the result of this
        journey is me, an extremely resilient person with a solid understanding
        of myself and the world around me. A student of life who will in any
        circumstance figure out a way to keep going and growing. But also, a
        full stack web developer who has found what he loves and is here to
        stay. I am aspiring to find a job in a company comprised of enthusiastic
        individuals, ansd within an environment that encourages me to give it
        all I have.
